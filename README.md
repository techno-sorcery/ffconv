## Description
ffconv is a simple front-end for ffmpeg, written in Bash. Its simple, easy-to-remember syntax allows for the easy conversion of audio files. It additionally uses "find" to recursively look for files in the input path (if desired), intelligently renames output files so they aren't saved with double extensions, and can delete source files when it's done.


## Installation
To run the script, you need bash, find, and (of course) ffmpeg.

Just download "ffconv", make it executable (if not already) with "sudo chmod +x ffconv.sh", and move it to your .local/bin folder.
